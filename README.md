# Kasm Workspaces Data Science Desktop Environment

This project provides a desktop environment geared for data science. It is meant as an example to using DevOps to provide a secure working environment for data science using the Kasm Workspaces platform.

Kasm Workspaces is a container streaming platform that provides browser-based access to desktops, applications, and web services. Kasm uses a modern DevSecOps approach for programmatic delivery of services via Containerized Desktop Infrastructure (CDI) technology to create on-demand Docker containers that are accessible via web browser. The rendering of the graphical-based containers is powered by the open-source project  [**KasmVNC**](https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC?utm_campaign=Dockerhub&utm_source=docker)

Kasm Workspaces was developed by a team of cybersecurity experts to meet the most demanding secure collaboration requirements.  Our solution makes use of the latest technology in DevOps to establish an architecture that is highly scalable, customizable, and easy to maintain.  Most importantly, Kasm provides a solution, rather than a service, so it is infinitely customizable to your unique requirements and includes a developer API so that it can be integrated with, rather than replace, your existing applications and workflows.

# Install Kasm Workspaces

Get the link to the latest install package from [Kasm Downloads](https://www.kasmweb.com/downloads.html?utm_campaign=Dockerhub&utm_source=docker)

```
wget https://<latest-kasm-version-url>
tar -xzvf kasm*.tar.gz
sudo kasm_release/install.sh
```

When the installation is complete it will output randomly generated credentials.

# Build Image

On the server that Kasm Workspaces is deployed on, build the image. You can also build this image in a pipeline and push to a central respository. Workspaces can point to a central repository and can automatically pull images when they are updated.

```
sudo docker build -t kasmweb/datascience:1.9.0 .
```

# Update Kasm Workspaces

Add a new Workspace image to the deployment and launch.

# Manual Deployment

While this image is primarily built to run inside the Kasm platform, it can also be executed manually.  Please note that certain functionality, such as audio, is only available within the Kasm platform.

```
sudo docker run --rm  -it --shm-size=512m -p 6901:6901 -e VNC_PW=password kasmweb/datascience:1.9.0
```

The container is now accessible via a browser : `https://<IP>:6901`

 - **User** : `kasm_user`
 - **Password**: `password`
